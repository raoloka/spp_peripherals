# ble_spp_peripheral
A ble spp peripheral (server) that has two way communication with a ble peripheral.
This project is to put together information to create ble spp peripherals (servers) that have two way communication with a ble cnetral (probably an android app, but could be anything else).
This repository contains information that I couldn't find elsewhere as of Feb.15, 2025.
